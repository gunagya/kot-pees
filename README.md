Skeletal framework of a card game in C++ implemented using OOPS concepts

This Project aims to explore a basic model of the game, wherein four players sitting on the same device can play a single game with each other. Sufficient instructions have been given throughout the program to ensure user-friendliness and appropriate precautions have been taken to prevent runtime errors or unfair play due to incorrect inputs.
